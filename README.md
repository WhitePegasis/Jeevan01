## General info
* This is an Android application whose backend is written in Java.
* As we know that during second wave of COVID-19, our country had to suffer alot. People were locked inside their houses due to lockdown restrictions. We even couldn't go outside for just consultation with doctors.
* Inspired by this, We developed this Jeevan application.
* This app provides three features to our users.
* First feature provides Real-time COVID-19 information. It gets updated as per the MHA website.
* Second feature is all about to check the availability of vaccination slot of a particular area. Apart from that we have used Work Manager library in the backend, so that even if the user somehow missed to see the notification, the application will ensure that it will keep notifying the user after a fixed interval of time.
* Coming on third feature, We have categorized our users into two more types. One is needers and other is doctors. A doctor can register himself using this feature and same applies for needer. When a needer log in into our app, he will be able to see list of all active doctors, with whom he may consult through chatting.
